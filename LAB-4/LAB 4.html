                    <strong>Hostel life</strong> during your <em>student years</em> is always busy and memorable, granted that it can make you irresponsible and reckless too. Getting up early in the morning can be a challenge, but you feel rewarded when you manage to do it.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Getting up around 7<sup>00</sup> A.M. and sleeping earlier at night at around 10<sub>00</sub> P.M. is ideal, as it allows you to be sharp throughout the day to navigate all the lectures, labs, and self-study sessions.

                    I enjoy <small><del>skipping</del></small> attending classes (hehe), participating in club activities, and spending some time with my friends in the hostel rooms. Admittedly, this isn't always possible during exam preparations, but you have to learn how to balance academics and fun.

                    Hostel life ultimately shaped me into a (moderately) disciplined individual, blessing me with <ins>better time management, an improved attitude towards teamwork, and lifelong friendships</ins>. I was content by the time I decided to transition into being a day scholar, starting a fresh chapter in my journey as I found myself needing to tilt the balance to favor academics. I'll cherish those memories always.
